## 1. Introduction
> Recently, deep ConvNets [14, 16] have significantly improved image classification [14] and object detection [9, 19] accuracy. Compared to image classification, object detection is a more challenging task that requires more complex methods to solve. Due to this complexity, current approaches (e.g., [9, 11, 19, 25]) train models in multi-stage pipelines that are slow and inelegant.
* Deep ConvNets 明显提高了 image classification 和 object detection 的 accuracy.
* Object detection 更具有挑战性。

> Complexity arises because detection requires the accurate localization of objects, creating two primary challenges. First, numerous candidate object locations (often called “proposals”) must be processed. Second, these candidates provide only rough localization that must be refined to achieve precise localization. Solutions to these problems often compromise speed, accuracy, or simplicity.
复杂是因为需要精确的确定物体的位置，主要有两个challenges:
* Numerous candidate object locations (proposals) must be processed, 候选区众多，需要处理；
* These candidates provide only rough localization，需要进一步 refine 来确定 precise localization.

### 1.1 R-CNN and SPPnet
> **R-CNN** has notable drawbacks:
> 1. Training is a multi-stage pipeline;
* R-CNN first finetunes a ConvNet on object proposals using log loss;
* It fits SVMs to ConvNet features;
* Bounding-box regressors are learned.
> 2. Training is expensive in space and time;
* For SVM and bounding-box regressor training, features are extracted from each object proposal in each image and written to disk. 提取的feature 数据需要写回磁盘。
> 3. Object detection is slow.
* At test-time, features are extracted from each object proposal in each test image. Detection with VGG16 takes 47s / image (on a GPU).   

* **R-CNN is slow because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal, without sharing computation. Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) [11] were proposedto speed up R-CNN by *sharing computation*.**

> **SPPnet** also has notable drawbacks:
> 1. Training is a multi-stage pipeline;
> 2. Training is expensive in time and space, features are also written to disk;
> 3. **But unlike R-CNN**, the fine-tuning algorithm proposed in [11] cannot update the convolutional layers that precede the spatial pyramid pooling. Unsurprisingly, this limitation (fixed convolutional layers) limits the accuracy of very deep networks.

### 1.2 Contributions
> We propose a new training algorithm that fixes the disadvantages of R-CNN and SPPnet, while improving on their speed and accuracy.
> The Fast R-CNN method has several advantages:
> 1. Higher detection quality (mAP) than R_CNN, SPPnet; 准确度更高
> 2. Training is single-stage, using a multi-task loss; 单阶段
> 3. Training can update all network layers; 可以更新所有网络层
> 4. No disk storage is required for feature caching. 不需要将参数写回disk

## 2. Fast R-CNN architecture and training
![Alt text](./1515692100686.png)
> A Fast R-CNN network takes as input an entire image and a set of object proposals. **($1$)** The network first processes the whole image with several convolutional ($conv$) and max pooling layers to produce a conv feature map. **($2$)** Then, for each object proposal a region of interest ($RoI$) pooling layer extracts a fixed-length feature vector from the feature map. **($3$)** Each feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected ($fc$) layers that finally branch into two sibling output layers: one that produces softmax probability estimates over $K$ object classes plus a catch-all “background” class and another layer that outputs four real-valued numbers for each of the K object classes. Each set of 4 values encodes refined bounding-box positions for one of the $K$ classes.

> * one produces a softmax probability estimates over $K$ object classes plus a catch-all "background" class;
> * another outputs four real-valued numbers for each $K$ object classes. Each set of 4 values encodes refined bounding-box positions for one of the $K$ classes. 输出K个object classes的坐标，每个class需要4个real-valued numbers来标记。

### 2.1 The RoI pooling layer
> The RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map with a fixed spatial extent of $H \times W$ (e.g., $7 × 7$), where $H$ and $W$ are layer hyper-parameters that are independent of any particular RoI.
* Convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map，即转换为更小的feature map.

### 2.2 Initializing from pre-trained networks
> When a pre-trained network initializes a Fast R-CNN network, it undergoes three transformations.
> First, the last max pooling layer is replaced by a RoI pooling layer that is configured by setting H and W to be compatible with the net’s first fully connected layer (e.g., H = W = 7 for VGG16). 
> Second, the network’s last fully connected layer and softmax (which were trained for 1000-way ImageNet classification) are replaced with the two sibling layers described earlier (a fully connected layer and softmax over K+1 categories and category-specific bounding-box regressors).
> Third, the network is modified to take two data inputs: a list of images and a list of RoIs in those images.
> 1. 最后的一个max pooling layer 用a RoI pooling layer代替，RoI pooling layer 的size是固定的；
> 2. 原来结构中的fully connected layer 和 softmax classification 用two sibling layer代替，two sibling layer (one for category and the other for bounding box)
> 3. 此时网络有两个输入：a list of image and a list of RoIs in those images.

### 2.3 Fine-tuning for detection
> Training all network weights with back-propagation is an important capability of Fast R-CNN.
> Why SSPnet is unable to update weights below the spatial pyramid pooling layer?
> *  The root cause is that back-propagation through the SPP layer is highly inefficient when each training sample ($i.e.$ RoI) came from a different image, which is exactly how R-CNN and SPPnet networks are trained. The inefficiency stems from the fact that each RoI may have a very large receptive field, often spanning the entire input image. Since the forward pass must process the entire receptive field, the training inputs are large (often the entire image).

> We propose a more efficient training method that takes advantage of feature sharing during training. In Fast RCNN training, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) minibatches are sampled hierarchically, first by sampling N images and then by sampling R/N RoIs from each image. **Critically, RoIs from the same image share computation and memory in the forward and backward passes. Making $N$ small decreases mini-batch computation.**
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) mini-batches are sampled hierarchically:
	* First by sampling $N$ images 
	* Then sampling $R/N$ RoIs from each image.

> One concern over this strategy is it may cause slow training convergence because RoIs from the same image are correlated.
> In addition to hierarchical sampling, Fast R-CNN uses a streamlined training process with one fine-tuning stage that jointly optimizes a softmax classifier and bounding-box regressors, rather than training a softmax classifier, SVMs, and regressors in three separate stages [9, 11]. The components of this procedure (the loss, mini-batch sampling strategy, back-propagation through RoI pooling layers, and SGD hyper-parameters) are described below.
> * 除了 hierarchical sampling，Fast R-CNN uses a streamlined training process，jointly 优化 softmax classifier 和 bounding-box regressors，而不是将 softmax classifier, SVMs and regressors 分成三个stage训练。

> **Multi-task loss** 
> A Fast R-CNN network has two sibling output layers. $(1)$ The first outputs a discrete probability distribution (per RoI), $p = (p_{0}, . . . , p_{K})$, over $K + 1$ categories. As usual, $p$ is computed by a softmax over the $K+1$ outputs of a fully connected layer. $(2)$ The second sibling layer outputs bounding-box regression offsets, $t^{k} =(t^{k}_{x}, t^{k}_{y}, t^{k}_{w}, t^{k}_{h})$, for each of the $K$ object classes, indexed by $k$. We use the parameterization for $t^{k}$ given in [9], in which $t^{k} specifies a scale-invariant translation and log-space height/width shift relative to an object proposal.
> Each training RoI is labeled with a ground-truth class u and a ground-truth bounding-box regression target v. We use a multi-task loss L on each labeled RoI to jointly train for classification and bounding-box regression:
$$
\begin {equation} \label {1}
L(p, u, t^{u}, v) = L_{cls}(p, u) + \lambda[u\ge1]L_{loc}(t^{u}, v)
\end {equation}
$$
in which $L_{cls}(p, u)=-log p_{u}$ is log loss for true class$u$.
> The second task loss, $L_{loc}$, is defined over a tuple of true bounding-box regression targets for class $u, v =(v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{w}, v_{h})$, and a predicted tuple $t^{u} = (t^{u}_{x} , t^{u}_{y} , t^{u}_{w}, t^{u}_{h} )$, again for class u. The Iverson bracket indicator function $[u \ge 1]$ evaluates to $1$ when $u \ge 1$ and $0$ otherwise. By convention the catch-all background class is labeled $u = 0$.

> **Mini-batch sampling** 
> During fine-tuning, each SGD mini-batch is constructed from $N = 2$ images, chosen uniformly at random (as is common practice, we actually iterate over permutations of the dataset). We use mini-batches of size $R = 128$, sampling $64$ RoIs from each image.

> **Back-propagation through RoI pooling layers** 
> Backpropagation routes derivatives through the RoI pooling layer. For clarity, we assume only one image per mini-batch (N = 1), though the extension to N > 1 is straightforward because the forward pass treats all images independently.

> **SGD hyper-parameters** 
> The fully connected layers used for softmax classification and bounding-box regression are initialized from zero-mean Gaussian distributions with standard deviations 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. Biases are initialized to 0. All layers use a per-layer learning rate of 1 for weights and 2 for biases and a global learning rate of 0.001.


### 2.4 Scale invariance
> We explore two ways of achieving scale invariant object detection: $(1)$ via “brute force” learning and $(2)$ by using image pyramids.

## 3. Fast R-CNN detection
> Once a Fast R-CNN network is fine-tuned, detection amounts to little more than running a forward pass (assuming object proposals are pre-computed). The network takes as input an image (or an image pyramid, encoded as a list of images) and a list of R object proposals to score. At test-time, R is typically around 2000, although we will consider cases in which it is larger ( 45k). When using an image pyramid, each RoI is assigned to the scale such that the scaled RoI is closest to 2242 pixels in area [11].

### 3.1 Truncated SVD for faster detection
> For whole-image classification, the time spent computing the fully connected layers is small compared to the conv layers. On the contrary, for detection the number of RoIs to process is large and nearly half of the forward pass time is spent computing the fully connected layers (see Fig. 2). Large fully connected layers are easily accelerated by compressing them with truncated SVD [5, 23].
* Classification 计算消耗的时间小，但是detection 需要计算大量的RoIs 去定位，所以 detection 会消耗大量的时间。
